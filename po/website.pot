"  <p>A spin on the phrase \"tag it!\", <a "
"href=\"https://www.taguette.org/\">Taguette</a> is a free and open-source"
" qualitative research tool (which works on all operating systems!) that "
"allows users to:</p>\n"
"\n"
"  <ul>\n"
"    <li>Import PDFs, Word Docs (.docx), Text files (.txt), HTML, EPUB, "
"MOBI, Open Documents (.odt), and Rich Text Files (.rtf).</li>\n"
"    <li>Highlight words, sentences, or paragraphs and tag them with the "
"codes you create.</li>\n"
"    <li>Work collaboratively with other users (if <a href=\"self-"
"host.html\">self-hosting</a> or using <a "
"href=\"https://app.taguette.org\">app.taguette.org</a>).</li>\n"
"    <li>Your data stays your own; export everything including your "
"project, highlights, documents, and codes.</li>\n"
"  </ul>\n"
"\n"
"  <p>...and much more! You can view our development queue on GitLab here:"
" <a "

"\n"
"  <p>Qualitative methods generate rich, detailed research materials that "
"leave individuals’ perspectives intact as well as provide multiple "
"contexts for understanding the phenomenon under study. Qualitative "
"methods are used in a wide range of fields, such as anthropology, "
"education, nursing, psychology, sociology, and marketing. Qualitative "
"data has a similarly wide range: observations, interviews, documents, "
"audiovisual materials, and more.</p>\n"
"\n"
"  <p>However - the software options for qualitative researchers are "
"either <strong>far too expensive</strong>, don't allow for the seminal "
"method of highlighting and tagging materials, <em>or actually perform "
"quantitative analysis</em>, just on text.</p>\n"
"\n"
"  <p><strong>It's not right or fair that qualitative researchers without "
"massive research funds cannot afford the basic software to do their "
"research.</strong></p>\n"
"\n"
"  <p>So, to bolster a fair and equitable entry into qualitative methods, "
"we've made Taguette!</p>\n"
