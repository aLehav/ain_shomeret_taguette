"\n"
"  <p>Qualitative methods generate rich, detailed research materials that "
"leave individuals’ perspectives intact  as well as provide multiple contexts "
"for understanding phenomenon under study. Qualitative methods are used by a "
"wide range of fields, such as anthropology, education, nursing, psychology, "
"sociology, and marketing. Qualitative data has a similarly wide range: "
"observations, interviews, documents, audiovisual materials, and more.</p>\n"
"\n"
"  <p>However - the software options for qualitative researchers are either "
"<strong>far too expensive</strong>, don't allow for the seminal method of "
"highlighting and tagging materials, <em>or actually perform quantitative "
"analysis</em>, just on text.</p>\n"
"\n"
"  <p><strong>It's not right or fair that qualitative researchers without "
"massive research funds cannot afford the basic software to do their research."
"</strong></p>\n"

"  <p>So, to bolster a fair and equitable entry into qualitative methods, "
"we've made Taguette!</p>\n"
