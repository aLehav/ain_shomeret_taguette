# About Taguette

A spin on the phrase "tag it!", Taguette is a free and open-source qualitative research tool that allows users to:

* Import a variety of text documents and formats
* Highlight words, sentences, or paragraphs and tag them with the codes you create
* Work collaboratively with other users (if self-hosting or using [app.taguette.org](https://app.taguette.org))
* Your data stays your own; export everything including your project, highlights, documents, and tags

...and much more! You can view our [development queue on GitLab](https://gitlab.com/remram44/taguette/-/boards). You can always add feature requests, bug reports, or general feedback via [GitLab issues](https://gitlab.com/remram44/taguette/-/issues). If you are not sure how to do that, feel free to email us your feedback at [hi@taguette.org](mailto:hi@taguette.org).

## Cite Taguette
If you use Taguette for your research, please cite it with the following:

## Motivation

Qualitative methods generate rich, detailed research materials that leave individuals’ perspectives intact as well as provide multiple contexts for understanding the phenomenon under study. Qualitative methods are used in a wide range of fields, such as anthropology, education, nursing, psychology, sociology, and marketing. Qualitative data has a similarly wide range: observations, interviews, documents, audiovisual materials, and more.

However - the software options for qualitative researchers are either far too expensive, don't allow for the traditional method of highlighting and tagging materials, or actually perform quantitative analysis, just on text.

**It's not right or fair that qualitative researchers without massive research funds cannot afford the basic software to do their research.**

So, to bolster a fair and equitable entry into qualitative methods, we've made Taguette!

## The Team

Taguette was developed by [Rémi Rampin](https://remi.rampin.org/). [Vicky Rampin](https://vicky.rampin.org/) and [Sarah DeMott](https://library.harvard.edu/staff/sarah-demott) provided the functional requirements, user needs, and testing in order to influence the initial development process.
