The package provides parsing tools for preparing transcript data. Many functions enable the user to aggregate data by any number of grouping variables, providing analysis and seamless integration with other R packages that undertake higher level analysis and visualization of text. This affords the user a more efficient and targeted analysis. 'qdap' is designed for transcript analysis, however, many functions are applicable to other areas of Text Mining/ Natural Language Processing.},
