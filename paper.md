# Summary

Taguette is a free and open source qualitative data analysis tool that allows users to upload text materials, highlight relevant passages, and assign a tag to it.

A spin on the phrase "tag it!", [Taguette](https://taguette.org) is a free and open source qualitative research tool that allows users to:

* Import PDFs, Word Docs (`.docx`), Text files (`.txt`), HTML, EPUB, MOBI, Open Documents (`.odt`), and Rich Text Files (`.rtf`).
* Highlight words, sentences, or paragraphs and tag them with the codes *you* create.
* (not yet) Group imported documents together (e.g. as 'Interview' or 'Lit Review').
* Export tagged documents, highlights for a specific tag, a list of tags with description and colors, and whole projects.

# Statement of Need

Qualitative methods generate rich, detailed research materials that leave individuals’ perspectives intact  as well as provide multiple contexts for understanding phenomenon under study. Qualitative methods are used by a wide range of fields, such as anthropology, education, nursing, psychology, sociology, and marketing. Qualitative data has a similarly wide range: observations, interviews, documents, audiovisual materials, and more.

However - the software options for qualitative researchers are either **far too expensive**, don't allow for the seminal method of highlighting and tagging materials, *or actually perform quantitative analysis*, just on text.

**It's not right or fair that qualitative researchers without massive research funds cannot afford the basic software to do their research.**

So, to bolster a fair and equitable entry into qualitative methods, we've made Taguette (@TAGUETTE)!

# Related Work

There have been fewer than twenty free and open source qualitative data analysis tools, *ever*. Examples include the Coding Analysis Toolkit (@CAT), Aquad (@AQUAD), RQDA (@RQDA), and KH Coder (@KH_CODER).

Today, there are three other free and open source qualitative analysis tools being currently developed and maintained. Each has a set of unique features that make them ideal for different use cases. QualCoder (@QualCoder), one such tool,
